## Network Policy Template

Network policies are essential for securing Kubernetes network traffic. They enable fine-grained control over how pods communicate with each other and with other network endpoints. This template offers a basic framework for creating a network policy to manage ingress and egress traffic for a group of pods.

### NetworkPolicy.yaml

Below is the `NetworkPolicy.yaml` configuration. Replace placeholder values (e.g., `<policy-name>`, `<namespace>`, `<app-label>`, etc.) with your actual values to tailor the policy to your needs.

```yaml
apiVersion: networking.k8s.io/v1
kind: NetworkPolicy
metadata:
  name: <policy-name>
  namespace: <namespace>
spec:
  podSelector:
    matchLabels:
      app: <app-label>
  policyTypes:
  - Ingress
  - Egress
  ingress:
  - from:
    - podSelector:
        matchLabels:
          app: <source-app-label>
    ports:
    - protocol: TCP
      port: <port>
  egress:
  - to:
    - podSelector:
        matchLabels:
          app: <destination-app-label>
    ports:
    - protocol: TCP
      port: <port>
```

### Customization Instructions

- `<policy-name>`: The name of your network policy.
- `<namespace>`: The Kubernetes namespace where the policy will be applied.
- `<app-label>`: The label of the pods the policy will apply to.
- `<source-app-label>` and `<destination-app-label>`: Labels for source and destination pods for ingress and egress rules, respectively.
- `<port>`: The TCP port number that the policy will apply to.

### How to Use

To implement your network policy within a Kubernetes environment, follow these steps:

1. **Prepare Your Network Policy Configuration**: Customize the `NetworkPolicy.yaml` by replacing all placeholder values with specific details relevant to your deployment scenario.

2. **Apply the Network Policy**: Deploy your network policy to your Kubernetes cluster using the following command:

    ```bash
    kubectl apply -f NetworkPolicy.yaml
    ```

3. **Verify the Policy**: You can verify that your network policy has been correctly applied and is active by using:

    ```bash
    kubectl describe networkpolicy <policy-name> -n <namespace>
    ```

    Replace `<policy-name>` and `<namespace>` with your network policy's name and its namespace to check the policy's details and status.
